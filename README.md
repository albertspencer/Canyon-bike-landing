# Canyon Bike Co — Landing Page


What it is
- A single static page (no build step): `index.html` + `styles.css`.
- Includes basic SEO (meta, JSON-LD), accessible form labels, and a booking CTA.

Why it’s useful
- Quick, low-cost way for a small business to get leads and bookings.
- Shows front-end skills, accessibility awareness, and practical AI use.

How to use
1. Replace contact info / images in `index.html`.
2. Push to a public repo named `canyon-bike-landing` and enable **Settings → Pages → main / (root)**.
3. Or serve locally: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/`.

Where AI helped
- I used AI to draft the hero copy, meta description, JSON-LD, alt text, and initial README/Reflection drafts.  
- I edited, integrated, and tested everything (roughly 50% AI / 50% me).

Files
- `index.html`, `styles.css`, `Reflection.md`
