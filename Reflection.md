I brainstormed project ideas with an AI assistant and selected the "Static Local Business Landing Page." The AI generated drafts for hero copy, alt text, meta tags, JSON-LD, and an accessibility checklist; I implemented the layout, integrated the outputs, tested accessibility, and deployed the site. The work split was roughly 50% AI draft generation and 50% human implementation and validation.
