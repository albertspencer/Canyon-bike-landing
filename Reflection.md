I brainstormed project ideas with an AI assistant and selected the "Static Local Business Landing Page." The AI generated drafts for hero copy, alt text, meta tags, jsonld, and an accessibility checklist. I implemented the layout, integrated the outputs, tested accessibility, and deployed the site. The work split was about 50% AI and 50% human implementation.
